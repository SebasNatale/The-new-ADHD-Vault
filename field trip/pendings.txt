PENDING STUFF AND OTHER NOTES

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MAIN MENU:

> Remember to add the pretty phrase, the one about delayed gratification, somewhere around here.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MUSIC ROOM:

> Web Workers are not natively supported by React; we tried all kinds of different implementations but nothing worked so we gotta look for a different solution, maybe using 3rd party libraries. Don't forget to post on forums too, the classic Google search turned out unsuccessful this time.

> So far the interface, beyond the 3 main modules (metronome, pomodoro clock, exercise viewer), is implemented as a bunch of functions on an external file waiting to be called. Start thinking about more concrete stuff to see if this is the right approach.

> While we figure out the web worker problem, seeing as tho we will need them for both the metronome and the pomodoro clock, we could start thinking about implementations of the exercise viewer module.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
DEV ROOM:

> I rather finish the Music Room first because this room requires backend implementation but one possible inferface could consist on some sort of goal tracker, maybe not as extensive as the RPG-style tracker we previously thought but something with to-do lists, goals and their trackers and the like.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
NO-SHIT ROOM:

> So far my only thoughts about this room are to make it a one-stop shop for low-dopamine days and mental emergencies, so basically some sort of ADHD knowledge base, but that will come later.
